# Software (no code required)

Very little user interaction is needed to run the machine. The size, shape, and location of the wound are determined using a sensor located near the nozzle of the printer. This can either be done manually through the placement of markers around the edges of the wound, or automatically by analyzing factors like the color of the skin versus the wound, topology, etc. The machine should then automatically deposit material onto the hand based on this data. The program itself can likely be run on a low-cost computer, such as a Raspberry Pi or cheap laptop, depending on the computational requirements for the software.
