# Biofabrication Design Project: Printing Skin
  Diabetic, venous, and pressure ulcers, along with other chronic wounds, put a burden on patients and surgeons, affect over 7 million in the patients in the United States, and have an annual expenditure of $25 billion. Grafts are often used for treatment of wounds, but they typically are expensive and result in poor cosmetic outcomes. As a result, tissue engineering approaches have been developed as an equivalent to grafts. 

  In this project, a bioplotter was designed to skin for wounds typically around 2 - 3 cm. To mimic the two main layers of skin, the dermis and the epidermis, keratinocytes and fibroblasts were used in a two nozzle system with a fibrinogen and thrombin gel system. Adjustments were made to maximize cell viability, wound healing, speed, and accuracy.
