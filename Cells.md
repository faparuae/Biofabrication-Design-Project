# Cells

### Composition of Skin
Skin consists of two main layers, the dermis and the epidermis. The dermis is the innermost layer of skin supported by subcutaneous tissue, and it contains fat that provides insulation. The dermis mostly consists of ECM, which is made out of collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans. Fibroblasts produce collagen and elastin, and they are the main type of cell in the dermis. Moving forward, the epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin and is made up of 90 - 95% keratinocytes. 

### Cell Source
For the bioplotter, a fibrinogen and thrombin gel system was chosen. Autologous primary human fibroblasts (hFBs) will be used for the dermis layer, and human keratinocytes (hKCs) cells will be used in the epidermis layer. Fibroblasts and keratinocytes were chosen because they make up most of their respective layers of skin. 

Autologous primary cells were chosen for a multitude of reasons. First, a large number of cells is needed for the bioplotter. The number of cells needed can be billions. In this case, primary cells can be easily isolated from a small biopsy from uninjured skin tissue in the patient, so obtaining enough cells would not be an issue. Furthermore, primary cells are more able to accurately represent skin. 

Autologous primary cells were chosen over allogenic cells because allogenic cells can result in an immune response and rejection that would disrupt healing. In the study, *In Situ Bioprinting of Autologous Skin Cells Accelerates Wound Healing of Extensive Excisional Full-Thickness Wounds*, a murine full thickness excisional wound in mice was used to validate the bioprinting system. The study used primary hFBs and hKCs with a fibrinogen and thrombin gel system. The study found that human fibroblasts and keratinocytes were present in the dermis and epidermis of the wound 3 weeks and 6 weeks after printing. In the same study, a porcine full-thickness wound model was used to compare autologous cells, allogenic cells, and untreated wounds. From weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5 after the bioprinting treatment, it was found that the autologous cell-treated wounds closed rapidly, and the open wound area was much smaller than all of the other groups. The authors of the study concluded that in situ bioprinting of autologous cells resulted in approximately 3-week acceleration in wound closure compared to the other treatments.
