# Mechanical Assembly

The design of the assembly was based on 2 primary factors, the ability to move in the X,Y and Z directions, and the speed necessary to successfully print skin.
This assembly was designed to print 2 layers of skin, the dermis and the epidermis, making motion in the Z direction necessary.
Skin is printed using a fibrinogen and thrombin gel system, requiring the use of 2 dual syringe-single nozzle systems, 1 for each layer of skin.
Each dual-syringe system utilizes a mixing nozzle to ensure proper ratios upon extrusion.
